1) You would be needing Visual Studio 2010 or a higher version installed to run this code.
2)Since I have coded in ASP.Net MVC4 Web Application, having .Net Framework 4 is required.
3)Connection to the database has been done with the help of DbSet property which has been enabled by installing 
  Entity Framework version 6.1.3. from NuGet Package version 2.0.30625.9003.
4)The project implements the basics of ASP.Net where the project 'MVCDemo1' opens up to the page http://localhost/MVCDemo1/Department
   which enlists the number of Departments each of which is presented as a hyper link.
5)On clicking each department, the page will be redirected to the next page where the names of the employees working in the respective
  department will be displayed.
6)The names will again be presented as hyperlinks which on being clicked will redirect to a page where their respective details 
  will be displayed.
